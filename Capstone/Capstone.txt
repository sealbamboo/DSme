Begin by Asking:

    What is the scope of the need or problem I wish to investigate?
    Who is this for? Who is impacted or affected by this data? Who would benefit from this model?
    What are my goals for this investigation?
    What does success look like? How will I know if my model performs well?
    Where will I find data for this project? Is the data available?

For the Bonus, Ask:

    What format is the data in? What specific steps do I need to take to access it?
    How will I explain this project to outside audiences?

Other Tips:

    For your 1st potential topic, start with an idea, then look for potential data that could be used to support that idea.
    For your 2nd potential topic, reverse the process; look for interesting data and then extrapolate problems it could solve and audiences it could impact.
